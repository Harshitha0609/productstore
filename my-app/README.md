# 🛍️ React E-Commerce Store

This project is a **modern e-commerce web application** built using **React + Vite** and powered by the **Fake Store API**.  
It displays products dynamically fetched from the API and allows users to **add items to a shopping cart** with real-time updates.

## 🧠 About the Project

The **React E-Commerce Store** demonstrates how to:
- Integrate an **external REST API** with React  
- Use **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`) for data and lifecycle management  
- Build **component-based UIs**  
- Handle **user events and conditional rendering**

The app fetches product details such as **title, price, and image** from the Fake Store API and displays them in a clean grid layout.  
Users can add items to their cart, with duplicates automatically prevented.
